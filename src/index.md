## What is a chrultrabook and who is this guide for?
A chrultrabook is a modified Chromebook that is able to run Windows, Linux, and sometimes macOS by using MrChromeboxâ€™s coreboot firmware. The purpose of this site is to provide documentation that is detailed, user-friendly, and has up to date information about the hardware, software, and firmware on Chromebooks.

--- 

## These docs focus on two main things:

- Installing Windows/Linux/macOS on your Chromebook.
- Learning in-depth information about your Chromebook.

Because of this, you are expected to read, learn, and use Google. **This is NOT a one click procedure.**
