You do not have to disable write protect if flashing [RW_Legacy](about#rw_legacy).

Refer to the [supported devices list](supported-devices.html) to figure out which method you need to use to disable write-protect on your device.

Depending on your device, you will need to do **one** of the following:
- Take out a WP screw
- [Unplug your battery](battery)
- Bridge two jumpers
- [Use a SuzyQable](suzyq) (A cable that enables CCD (Closed Case Debug))
