## Recovery Mode

{: .note }
Your data is unaffected in recovery mode unless you use a recovery image or enter [developer mode](entering-developer-mode.md).

Recovery Mode is a mode that all chromeOS devices enters when it detects an issue with chromeOS or the firmware that prevents it from booting normally. Used to recover the operating system and firmware. Also can be entered manually. 
### Entering Recovery Mode

**Chromebooks**

Press `ESC` + `Refresh` (arrow icon) + `Power` at the same time. This should bring your system into recovery mode.
- For some devices the power button is on the side.

When you do, use something like a paper clip to hold the button down, then turn on the device. This should bring your system into recovery mode.
