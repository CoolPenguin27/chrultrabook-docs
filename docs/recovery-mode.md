{: .note }
Your data is unaffected in recovery mode unless you use a recovery image or enter [developer mode](entering-developer-mode.md).

{: .warning }
Do not continue if your device is currently owned or enrolled by a organization, such as a school or employer. Unless you were given permission by your organization, its a crime.

Recovery mode is used to restore the OS and RW regions of the firmware. It gets triggered when an issue with the device is detected, or you manually start it.
### Entering Recovery Mode
<br>
**Chromebooks**

Press `ESC` + `Refresh` (arrow icon), + `Power` at the same time. This should bring your system into recovery mode.
- For some devices the power button is on the side.
- Some devices may need to hold down the `Fullscreen` button (four corners icon) instead of the `Refresh` button.

Find the recovery button hole. A reference of what to look for is below.

When you do, use something like a paper clip to hold the button down, then turn on the device. This should bring your system into recovery mode.
You can stop holding down the button at this point.

**Tablets**

Hold down `Volume Up` + `Volume Down` + `Power` for 10 seconds, then release. This should bring your system into recovery mode.
