Developer Mode is a alternate mode that all chromeOS devices have that opens up the ability to make unverified changes to the operating system and hardware.
### Entering Developer Mode
Todo: Add alternate steps for devices with a recovery button/alternate combination.
1. Press `ESC` + `Refresh` (arrow icon) + `Power` at the same time. This should bring your system into recovery mode.

2. Press `CTRL` +  `D` at the same time. This should bring up a warning asking for confirmation for either "Turn OS Verification OFF" or "Enable Developer Mode".

3. Press `Enter`. The screen should turn off breifly and bring you to the "You are in Developer Mode" or "OS Verification is OFF" screen.

4. Press `CTRL` +  `D` to boot from internal disk.
